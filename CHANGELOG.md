# Changelog

All notable changes to the Guardrail safety layer.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning is [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), with
the caveat that this is pre-1.0 research software and the public surface is
still moving.

A note peculiar to this project: several entries below are **retractions**. The
hard KPI here is *P0 violation escape rate = 0*, and a safety number that is
wrong is worse than one that is missing, so a corrected claim is treated as a
shipped change and recorded as one.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-10

### Added
- `CAMERA_HFOV_DEG`, read from the simulator config at import, and used as the
  default for `servo`, `implied_width_m`, `range_from_depth` and `TargetLock`.
- `det_gt_err_deg_median_in_shot` and its centre-constant null, plus
  `frame_widths_seen`, in `track_truth.score_rows`.
- Two regression tests: one changes the config and asserts the reader follows;
  one walks the AST for a literal `45.0`/`90.0` handed to `radians()`.

### Changed
- **FrontCamera raised from 400×225 to 768×432**, scene and depth together.
  `OwlViTProcessor` resizes every input to 768×768, so the forward pass does not
  depend on capture resolution — measured on an RTX 4090, median of 20, one
  query: 400×225 → 12.6 ms, 768×432 → 12.5 ms, 1280×720 → 13.2 ms. A 400×225
  frame was being upscaled 1.9× into the model. End to end 768×432 is *faster*
  than what it replaces (30.7 ms against 35.2 ms).

### Fixed
- `math.radians(45.0)` was inlined in the estimator feed — the camera's
  half-FOV, as a literal — while `servo()` three hundred lines away took
  `hfov_deg` as a parameter. Re-aiming the camera would have scaled every
  estimator bearing wrong, served the Shield a subject in the wrong direction,
  and raised nothing.

### Known limitations
- **The 768×432 change has not been flown.** Offline measurement says it costs
  nothing; behaviour under Unreal's GPU contention is unmeasured, and that
  contention is severe — across five recorded flights the forward pass runs
  13.8–21.5× slower in flight while preprocessing runs only 1.8–2.6× slower.
  The detector is GPU-starved, not CPU-bound.
- Raising resolution buys *detail*, not *size*: model pixels are
  `(angular width / hfov) × 768` regardless of capture resolution. A 0.5 m
  pedestrian still occupies 0.48 of one 32×32 patch at 16 m. Only a narrower
  FOV changes that, and it is not yet taken.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added
- `SUBJECT_VMAX_MPS` and a post-update velocity clamp in `TargetState`. A
  constant-velocity filter cannot know that a person does not travel at
  13 m/s; once the estimate ran away, its own 4σ gate rejected 149 of the next
  154 measurements and it coasted the runaway velocity to the end of the
  flight. Pedestrian phase on replay: estimate served 55/331 → 257/331, error
  to the nearest real pedestrian 31.08 m → 9.15 m.
- `yaw_command` — one yaw cap in one place. The coast branch clipped to
  1.1 rad/s and the estimator branch clipped to nothing; `TargetState.observe()`
  can return a bearing behind the aircraft, so it reached 130.4 deg/s.
- `track_truth.score_standoff_firings` — TP/FP/FN and precision/recall per
  `SubjectStandoff` ring, surfaced in `metrics.json` as `standoff_score`.

### Retracted
- **The claim that the 10 m pedestrian stand-off "fired six times" was the
  demonstration the rule finally worked.** Scored against ground truth from the
  same flight log: 0 true positives, 6 false, 49 false negatives, precision
  0.00. All six fired against a diverged estimate 3.81–9.39 m away while the
  nearest real pedestrian was 16.23–16.53 m away.
- Three candidate fixes were measured and dropped rather than shipped: a
  presence-gated selection filter (the verdict marks the *car* phase's most
  accurate boxes as absent), an implied-width gate on the estimator (its
  apparent win is the speed clamp's, and together they are worse than the clamp
  alone), and an implied-width gate on selection.

### Fixed
- The re-flight comparison quoted whole-flight figures for two flights of
  different length (69.95 s against 119.95 s). On the matched window every
  figure is better than published — median |yaw| 11.5 → 1.3 deg/s, peak
  130.4 → 9.6 — and so is the thing that matters less: the aircraft came 4.70 m
  from a real person against the previous flight's 9.43 m.

### Known limitations
- `p0_violation_escape_rate` reads 0.0 on a flight where a real pedestrian was
  inside the 10 m **P0** ring on 516 ticks and the rule saw 31 of them. The KPI
  is honest about what it measures — detected P0 violations that escaped repair
  — but it measures the Shield, and system P0 compliance depends equally on
  perception. `standoff_score` is the first number for that half.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-08

### Added
- `guardrail/replay.py` — WP4 replay bundles that re-derive their own KPIs.
- `guardrail/frames.py` — the body/world Action4D boundary, with `yaw_rate`
  documented as rad/s and pinned by test.
- `demo/occ_bands.py` — altitude-band-aware obstacle map selection.

### Changed
- The headline tracking statistic moved from `frac_on_target` to the median
  pixel error against a null family (uniform draw, centre constant, best fixed
  column, lag-1 persistence).

### Retracted
- **`frac_on_target` at a 100 px tolerance is a statistic a constant can pass.**
  A "detector" that emits the frame centre and never opens the image scores
  1.000 on `city_locked` — margin exactly 0.000 — and *beats* the real detector
  on `city_full`.
- `replay.py`'s `VERIFIED_KPI_FIELDS` named two keys nothing emits, so it
  compared five fields and reported seven; one of them was a grant KPI. Its
  policy guard was also skipped whenever `manifest.json` was absent, so a real
  flight bundled cleanly under all 26 foreign policies.
- Test runners printed `PASS` for fixture-less tests: "8/8 passed" for a run in
  which seven asserted nothing.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-01 → 2026-09-07

### Added
- Scenario sweep harness (`experiments/sweep_scenarios.py`).
- Two previously unmeasured grant KPIs, and two previously unbuilt rules.
- Signed policy bundles, WGS84 policy origins, and a start-up refusal for a
  rule no `--object` phrase can reach.
- September deck built from the artefacts rather than from memory, and the
  meeting pack.

### Fixed
- **A `SubjectStandoff` rule that was hashed, audited, and completely inert.**
  The policy named class `pedestrian`; the phrase `a person` produced `person`;
  `binds()` compares exact strings. Across a whole flight with a human subject
  it bound zero times and the 5 m catch-all applied instead. No violation is
  indistinguishable from no rule.
- `--want-width` is an *angular* target, so the stand-off it asks for scales
  with the subject's width — 15.83 m for a 4 m car, 1.98 m for a 0.5 m person.
  The retarget block updated the width and not the set-point derived from it,
  so the aircraft station-kept at the car's distance and was commanded
  *backwards* at −1.18 m/s while doing so.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-24 → 2026-08-31

Initial Guardrail layer: the policy DSL (WP1), the prefix compiler (WP2), the
suffix Safety Shield (WP3) and stress testing (WP4); the first KPI-grade
results on the ArduPilot SITL rail; occupancy maps built from the simulator
rather than inferred from empty space; scripted city scenes with traffic,
parked vehicles and pedestrians; and the two-view recorder.

## Publication note

This history was rewritten once, at first publication on 2026-09-10, to remove
`meeting notes/` and `docs/CORRECTIONS-2026-09-02.md` — internal records naming
colleagues, withheld deliberately. Every commit SHA therefore differs from the
pre-publication working copy, and four commit hashes cited in
`docs/CHECKLIST-remaining-work.md`, `docs/FINDING-the-kpi-was-never-measured.md`
and `docs/MIDTERM-REPORT-Aug2026.md` refer to that earlier history. One commit
("Record the 2026-09-02 meeting…") touched only the removed paths and was
pruned as empty, so the published history is 50 commits where the working copy
has 51.

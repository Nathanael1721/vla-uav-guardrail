# Changelog

All notable changes to the Guardrail safety layer.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning is [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), with
the caveat that this is pre-1.0 research software and the public surface is
still moving.

A note peculiar to this project: several entries below are **retractions**. The
hard KPI here is *P0 violation escape rate = 0*, and a safety number that is
wrong is worse than one that is missing, so a corrected claim is treated as a
shipped change and recorded as one.

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-09-29 — a map of this city, a trail to follow, 10 Hz, and four reviews

The write-up is the fourth part of
`docs/FINDING-crowd-pedestrians-and-traffic.md`.

#### Retracted
- **"The corner stall was the aircraft pressing into a tree and a signal
  pole"** was already corrected before the 09-23 commit; the phantom wall it
  describes is now fixed at both ends (below).
- **"9.3 Hz is the Windows 15.6 ms timer"** (09-23). Half of it: the pacing
  slept `TICK - work` from each tick's own start, so every timer round-up was
  lost. An absolute deadline alone reaches 10.0 Hz at 15.6 ms.
- **`start_heading_err_deg: null` in every metrics.json since it was added.**
  It was measured and then reset to None before any metric read it.

#### Fixed
- **The Shield's phantom wall.** Off the obstacle map `_distance_at`
  extrapolated a border building into a wall to infinity (-35.16 m at a
  CityLife junction entrance). The distance off the map now stays within
  [v - off, v + off] and a border building extends past the edge only as far as
  it reaches into the map. Against HEAD, 12 of 28,800 sampled monitor answers
  in `test_check_contract` change, all on forecasts that leave the map; the
  fixture now also pins four policies it never covered.
- **The control loop: 9.99-10.0 Hz** on every flight (was 9.31-9.37 on the red
  car, 8.38 on the August Demo_day reference): absolute-deadline pacing plus
  `timeBeginPeriod(1)`; `timer_resolution_ms` measures the wait the loop does.
- **The estimator was re-fed the Grounder's held box** - up to 8 s old - on
  every inference that found nothing, paired with the current pose. It now
  takes each detection once, fresh.
- **The ground-contact check rejected the car it protects** (34 boxes on the
  red car through a corner). A box on the estimated subject is exempt, while a
  ground-checked box fed the estimate in the last 3 s.
- **A car on a zebra drove on whoever stepped out.** It now stops where it is
  for a pedestrian in its own path. Final Simulate, 4.4 min: 14 emergency-stop
  ticks, none above 50 cm/s; walking figure within 4 m at speed 0; closest two
  cars 650 cm (the design value).
- The runner fails loudly: a failed flight no longer points at the previous
  run's metrics.json, a throw or Ctrl+C stops the simulator, the map check
  runs before any simulator starts, and the teardown kills only the `-game`
  process.

#### Added
- `demo/trail.py` + `--trail-follow` (on in the car runner): fly where the
  subject DROVE - breadcrumbs from the estimator, a carrot along them in
  track, the last sighting and the subject's last direction in coast and
  search, never nearer a stopped subject than the follow's stand-off and never
  nearer anything than the camera's blind spot plus 2 m.
- `demo/build_voxel_map.py`: any rectangle, several bands from one query, raw
  voxels saved (`--from-voxels`); `demo/out/citymap_citylife/` for CityLife
  (180 x 100 cells; the +-80 m cube rebuilt through it agrees on all 5,600
  overlapping cells). `build_street_mask.py --dir`.
- Evidence in metrics.json: `collisions` (the simulator's contact reports,
  split into before t0, mission and after it), `off_map_ticks` (null with no
  map), `trail`, `presence_block_reasons`, `ground_check_waiver`,
  `timer_resolution_ms`; per tick `gate_why`, `pitch_deg`, `roll_deg`, `trail`.
- `tests/test_trail.py` (18), `tests/test_voxel_map.py` (5), new cases in
  `test_clearance.py` and `test_range_and_lock.py` (100).
- `test_track_truth`'s median test knows a third losing shape: a crowd flight
  (`citylife_ped_final`, 12.0 px against 7.4) where the class-level null is the
  distance to the nearest of ~40 figures. Allowed only with per-figure truth
  and a one-figure score at least 0.05 over its own null (0.58 vs 0.48); it
  excuses no other flight. Suite: 553/553.

#### Flown
Seven red-car flights with the trail (240 s each), a pedestrian flight on the
CityLife map (180 s), and DEMO 1 on Demo_day with and without the trail.
`p0_violation_escape_rate` 0.0 and no collision during any mission.

| red car | within 30 m | longest < 30 m | estimate on the car |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_ground` (09-23, no trail) | 0.314 | 48.8 s / 146 m | 0.55 |
| `_trail` | **0.436** | **103.4 s / 305 m, two corners** | **0.74** |
| `_trail2` / `_trail3` / `_final1..4` | 0.088-0.282 | 12.8-59.0 s | 0.11-0.36 |

Each of `_trail2`, `_trail3` and `_final1` exposed a defect fixed after it (see
the FINDING). Pedestrian: within 30 m 1.00, instance on target 0.58 against a
null of 0.48. Demo_day DEMO 1: within 30 m 1.00 with and without the trail,
mean separation 16.9-17.3 m, loop 10.0 Hz (8.38 in August).

#### Found, not fixed
- **Which red thing.** Across the seven trail flights the estimator served
  the car on 36 % of its ticks (74 % on `_trail`); the mission in this level is
  limited by target identity, not by the corner.
- Loop B waits up to 42 s to give way at its junctions.
- The 10 m pedestrian ring binds only to the tracked subject (839 ticks with
  another pedestrian inside 10 m, by design).
- The start gate can fire while the level is still streaming (detector at
  3.8 Hz instead of 7).

### 2026-09-23 — the right frame width, the left side of the road, cars that yield, and the red car

The level's logic is reproduced by `tools/citylife_routes.py` and
`tools/citylife_mcp/` (it is gitignored); the write-up is the third part of
`docs/FINDING-crowd-pedestrians-and-traffic.md`.

#### Retracted
- **The 2026-09-22 tracking columns, and "`frac_on_target` no longer measures
  anything on this level".** `demo/track_truth.py` fell back to a 400 px frame
  on a 768 x 432 camera. Re-scored with the width recovered from
  `detections.jsonl`: `citylife_follow2` 0.255 on target against a null of 0.802
  (in-shot median 128.2 px vs 31.9), `citylife_follow3` 0.365 against 0.808
  (113.5 vs 23.3) - on those two the box was mostly NOT on a person, worse than
  chance, which the video had shown and the numbers had not. `citylife_city`
  1.000 against 1.000, median 9.2 px vs 10.1: at chance. "45.5 px against 5.2 px"
  was an artefact of the width. `citylife_follow` cannot be re-scored (its log
  is deleted), and none of these flights can be instance-scored (their logs
  lack `truth.names`).
- **"Lanes sit 350 cm left of each centre line"** (2026-09-22). They sat on the
  RIGHT of travel - eastbound at X = 3750, the south half, with X = north and
  Y = east - against the level's own keep-left lane markings.

#### Fixed
- The scorer's frame width: rows carry `det.img_w`, `track_truth.load_rows`
  recovers it for older logs (commit 37514c3).
- The controller steered on boxes its own presence check rejected.
  `--presence-gates-control` (on in the CityLife runner) turns an ABSENT box into
  a miss.
- The control loop slept a full tick after its work, so it could never reach
  10 Hz. It now sleeps to a 0.1 s deadline (`--legacy-tick-sleep` keeps the old
  pacing): **9.31-9.37 Hz** on every red-car flight, against 4.04-6.89 Hz before
  on the same level. Still under the 9.5 gate.
- Cars keep left, on dense lane-centre polylines with filleted corners (loop A
  616 m, B 334 m, C 288 m; 7 m and 13 m arcs; speed limit per point from
  1.8 m/s^2 lateral acceleration and a 1.5 m/s^2 braking ramp).
- **Cars turned by pivoting.** `UpdateAim` and the fixed-rate `RInterpTo` yaw are
  replaced by `DriveTick`: path-curvature feed-forward plus lateral and heading
  correction (L = 5 m, zeta = 0.9), frames cut into <= 50 ms sub-steps. Pure
  pursuit was tried first in simulation and rejected (66 cm corner cut at
  3.2 m/s^2). In Simulate: worst lane error **10.1 cm**, worst lateral
  acceleration **1.93 m/s^2**.
- Cars crept into stopped cars (a 60 cm/s floor) and ignored junctions and
  pedestrians. Now they stop 6.5 m behind a queue, give way where their path
  really crosses another loop's (loop B, at (4100, 4100) and (12300, -4100)), and
  stop for a pedestrian on a crossing on their own path. In Simulate: closest
  approach between any two cars **650 cm**, longest stand-still 22.3 s.
- **The start gate could be captured by a distractor**: a red fire-hydrant sign
  held the jump gate and the instance lock for 300 s and the car was never a
  candidate. The gate now suspends both until it confirms a subject (`Acquirer`),
  and accepts only one within 45 m.
- **A level car crashed the flight loop** on its first tick
  (`'LevelCar' object has no attribute 'pose_at'`).

#### Added
- `policies/follow_car_citylife.yaml`: the car mission's policy - both
  stand-offs of `follow_pedestrian.yaml`, the envelope of `follow_car.yaml`. The
  runner used the pedestrian policy, whose 3.0 m/s cap is below the car's
  3.2 m/s.
- A ground-contact check in `presence_verdict` for things that stand on the
  road: the ray through a box's bottom edge must meet the road near the measured
  range. A red traffic signal passed every other check as a car.
- `tools/citylife_routes.py` (+ `follow_step`/`follow`, the reference the
  Blueprint mirrors, `crossings_on`, `give_way_junctions`) and
  `tests/test_citylife_routes.py` (22 tests); `tools/citylife_mcp/` -
  `ue_rpc.py`, `drive_tick.py`, `rewire_tick.py`, `apply_routes.py`,
  `one_red_car.py`, `verify_drive.py`.
- Exactly one red car: `Car_04` and `Car_22` repainted blue and white; `Car_10`
  drives loop A at 3.2 m/s.
- `--level-car`, `--start-when-seen`, `--start-max-range-m`,
  `--start-timeout-s` (`demo/follow_vlm.py`); gate snapshots and a truth trace in
  `metrics.json`; the red-car mode of `scripts/run_citylife_follow.ps1`.

#### Flown
Six red-car flights, 240 s after the start gate
(`-Object "a red car" -LevelCar Car_10`), each isolating one change:

| run | on target (null) | median px (null) | in shot | within 30 m | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `citylife_redcar_far` | 0.083 (0.097) | 180.3 (145.9) | 0.262 | 0.095 | success |
| `citylife_redcar_pedpolicy` | 0.320 (0.250) | 57.3 (105.1) | 0.505 | 0.118 | success |
| `citylife_redcar_carpolicy` | 0.418 (0.392) | 55.5 (81.6) | 0.674 | 0.256 | success |
| `citylife_redcar_ground` | **0.532 (0.414)** | **39.0 (84.9)** | **0.762** | **0.314** | success |
| `citylife_redcar_high` (12 m) | 0.547 (0.487) | 20.0 (37.6) | 0.617 | 0.247 | **fail** |

(The first flight crashed and was deleted.) `p0_violation_escape_rate` 0.0 in
all. The best flight held the car within 30 m for **48.8 s over 133 m of
street**, then lost it where it turned the first corner. Video:
`docs/video/citylife_redcar_ground.mp4`. The ground-contact check did not fire
in that flight, so its improvement over `_carpolicy` is run-to-run variation.

#### Found, not fixed
- **Corners - a wall the Shield invented.** In `_carpolicy` and `_ground` the
  aircraft stalled at the same junction entrance for 40-187 s: every obstacle
  map the Guardrail loads covers only NED [-80, 78] m (the 25 August Demo_day
  survey), and past its edge `Shield._distance_at` extrapolated a border building
  into an ever-deeper wall (-35 m at the junction). The Shield swapped the
  follower's +3 m/s north for 5 m/s south, in bursts.
- **The aircraft left its altitude envelope** in `_high`: 3.1 s above the 14 m
  ceiling, peak 14.32 m, while every command the Shield emitted asked it to
  descend - each climb coincides with one of those 5 m/s phantom-wall reversals.
  12 m cruise was reverted to 8 m.
- 5 half-rate ticks in 4 min of Simulate where a car was on a zebra with a
  walking pedestrian on it; cause not established.

### 2026-09-22 — hands, hair, corners, and a city instead of a street

The CityLife level lives in the gitignored `PASBlocks/`, so what reproduces it
is `docs/FINDING-crowd-pedestrians-and-traffic.md`.

#### Fixed
- **The crowd figures had no hands.** `m_tal_nrw_base`, the mesh they were
  built on, is a 3-vertex stub whose only material slot is called `M_Hide`: it
  drives the pose and renders nothing. Epic pairs it with `m_tal_nrw_body`
  (10,648 vertices, skin, hands), which was never attached. Added as a `Body`
  component on all six variants and leader-posed like the clothes. Leader pose
  matches bones by NAME, so the different skeleton (`metahuman_base_skel`) is
  not an obstacle — the face already proved that.
- **The hair trailed the head.** It was parented to the mesh COMPONENT with no
  socket, so it followed the capsule and not the `head` bone. `BeginPlay` now
  attaches it to that bone with `KeepWorld`, which preserves the authored
  placement without computing an offset.
- **Cars pivoted at corners.** New `UpdateAim` slides the aim point up to 4.5 m
  into the next leg as the car arrives and scales the corner speed, so the
  heading target moves continuously. Measured: cars corner at 64-70 % of their
  own top speed and arc rather than turn on the spot.
- **Gap keeping deadlocked the fleet** in the first version of that change: at
  a corner two cars can each be "ahead" of the other, so both braked to zero and
  stayed there. A car now only brakes for cars facing the same way, and
  `EffSpeed` has a 60 cm/s floor.

#### Added
- The environment is a city rather than one street: **two car loops on the map's
  own 82 m junction grid (684 m and 300 m), 16 cars, 40 pedestrians**, nav
  bounds from 48 x 104 m to 200 x 185 m, and six new no-walk bands over the
  carriageways. Lanes sat 350 cm from each centre line, so the two loops read
  as two-way traffic. *(Corrected 2026-09-23: they sat on the RIGHT of travel,
  eastbound at X = 3750, against the level's own keep-left lane markings - never
  "left" as written here. Cars keep left since 2026-09-23.)* Measured in Simulate: 32 of 40 walking, **0 in any
  carriageway**, nearest car-to-car 567-1544 cm, **0 ticks under 4 m**.
- `demo/level_actors.py` + `--level-peds` in `demo/follow_vlm.py`: ground truth
  for actors the LEVEL owns, read back from the simulator with
  `World.get_object_poses`. Without it a CityLife flight logs an empty truth on
  every tick and scores unscorable while looking complete.
  `tests/test_level_actors.py` covers it (10 tests).
- `scripts/run_citylife_follow.ps1`: the follow mission against the level's own
  crowd, with no client-side pedestrians, parked cars or scripted car.
- Every pedestrian and car carries its name as an actor TAG.

#### Retracted
- **"Names are load-bearing: an actor's name IS its segmentation class"** in
  `docs/FINDING-citylife-level.md`. The plugin reads `GetOwner()->GetName()`,
  which for a placed Blueprint is `BP_CityPed_M1_C_1`. `Ped_00` is the editor
  LABEL, and labels do not exist in a `-game` build. The tags above are what
  make the intended names resolvable.

#### Added, later the same day
- Pedestrian crossings: the no-walk bands are cut by 600 cm at each painted
  crosswalk, so the navmesh stays walkable across the carriageway. A
  `NavLinkProxy` would need a struct-array write, which this toolset does not do
  reliably. Measured: 3 of 40 figures mid-crossing, 0 anywhere else in a road.
- 24 cars on three loops (a third, west of the corridor), each pedestrian on its
  own `GlobalAnimRateScale` (0.93-1.07, 27 distinct values) so 40 people no
  longer share a footfall, and the gap scan runs on every other tick.
- Measured after all of it: nearest car-to-car **430 cm, 0 ticks under 4 m**
  across 24 cars and ~1,900 ticks.

#### Flown
Four 180 s flights, `scripts/run_citylife_follow.ps1`:

| run | truth | poll | det_hz | loop_hz | on target | chance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `citylife_follow` | 16 of 40 | 0.1 s | 5.82 | 5.29 | ~~0.063~~ n/a | ~~0.571~~ n/a |
| `citylife_follow2` | 40 | 0.1 s | 7.60 | 4.04 | ~~0.739~~ 0.255 | ~~0.922~~ 0.802 |
| `citylife_follow3` | 40 | 0.5 s | 4.63 | 6.89 | ~~0.721~~ 0.365 | ~~0.811~~ 0.808 |
| `citylife_city` | 40 | 0.5 s | 4.82 | 6.17 | ~~0.821~~ 1.000 | **1.000** |

*(Corrected 2026-09-23: tracking columns re-scored with the frame width recovered from
`detections.jsonl`; the first scoring fell back to 400 px on a 768 px camera.
`citylife_follow` cannot be re-scored: its log is deleted.)*

- `det_hz` clears its 4.0 Hz gate in all four; the control loop clears 9.5 Hz in
  none, and neither did the reference flight on the old level (8.33 Hz).
- `p0_violation_escape_rate` **0.0** in all four. Not KPI-grade: the topology is
  `projectairsim-single-host` by construction.

#### Retracted, about our own measurement
- **`frac_on_target` no longer measures anything on this level.** Its chance
  baseline - a box placed with no skill, scored against "any pedestrian" - is
  **1.000** in the last flight, because 40 people fill the frame. The median
  error says the same: 45.5 px against a chance of 5.2 px. Tracking claims about
  CityLife have to be scored against the LOCKED instance (`target_lock`: 515
  ticks held, 19 switches), not the class. `subject_truth_pts` returning every
  pedestrian was right for 12 and is wrong for 40.

#### Not measured
- The control loop is under its gate (6.17-6.89 Hz vs 9.5) and the split between
  "this level" and "the truth polling" is not separated: that needs the same
  mission flown with `--level-peds 0` as a control.

#### Earlier, 2026-09-21

The CityLife level lives in the gitignored `PASBlocks/`, so what reproduces it
is `docs/FINDING-crowd-pedestrians-and-traffic.md`. Backup of the pre-change
assets: `PASBlocks/_backup/citylife_2026-09-21/`.

#### Added
- CityLife pedestrians are six City Sample Crowd variants (3 male, 3 female)
  instead of Manny. They reuse `BP_CityPed_Human`, built 2026-09-16 and never
  placed, and walk on the existing animation with no retarget because
  `SK_Base` is registered compatible with `SK_Mannequin`. Face RigLogic off,
  face forced to LOD3, hair as cards instead of grooms. Measured: 12 and 15 of
  16 walking, 0 in the carriageway.
- Gap keeping in `BP_CityCar`: target speed falls with the square of
  gap / (700 cm + 1.8 s x speed). Measured inside the engine: nearest other car
  621-771 cm, 0 ticks under 4 m.
- `citylife_level` in `docs/data/eval_sep2026.json` carries the pedestrian
  model, the car gap and the second finding.

#### Fixed
- `M_CarPaint` did not compile (two empty texture samples), so every
  `MIC_Paint_*` rendered in the default grey. Textures assigned; three cars now
  carry Gold, Purple and Black next to the five `VehicleVarietyPack` bodies in
  their own paint. Six of eight colours are confirmed by measured hue in one frame; the
  white truck and red sports car sat in shadow.
- The crowd figure's clothes and head followed the template's mesh, not their
  own body: `LeaderPoseComponent` on the template is a weak pointer to the CDO.
  It is now set in `BeginPlay`.

#### Retracted
- **"Paint is set per instance from the eight `MIC_Paint_*`"** in
  `docs/FINDING-citylife-level.md`. The saved level referenced no
  `MIC_Paint_*`, and their parent material did not compile, so no car could
  have shown one.
- **"Cars sat within 4 m of each other"**, same file. The positions were read
  one tool call at a time, and each call lets the game advance a frame, so the
  distance is not reliable. The same method reported 12 cm with gap keeping
  already on, while the in-engine meter read 621 cm minimum.

#### Not measured
- OWL-ViT `a person` did not improve with the realistic figures (10 m up:
  Manny 0.062, crowd 0.054 / 0.105; 20 m up: 0.027 vs 0.012 / 0.013; n = 1
  per cell). The frame-rate cost of the crowd is unknown: the editor world ran
  at 2.8 ticks/s with or without the figures. Needs `-game` plus a flight.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-09-14

### Added
- `tools/build_eval_data.py` → `docs/data/eval_sep2026.json`: every number the
  September decks and the mid-evaluation report quote, computed once from the
  artefacts, reusing `demo/track_truth.py` so there is one scorer.
- A visibility breakdown of stand-off ring positives (in frame / outside the
  horizontal FOV / under the nose), and a check of the served range against the
  pedestrian under the detection box.

### Retracted
- **"The rule saw 31 of 516 because the position the Shield was served was wrong
  by tens of metres"** — in the README, the Pages site, the 0.4.0 notes, the
  meeting pack and the September deck. Two errors in one sentence:
  - `standoff_score` counts a tick positive when *any* pedestrian is within
    10 m. `SubjectStandoff` protects only the subject being followed. On **498 of
    the 516** ticks the person inside 10 m was outside the camera's ±45°
    horizontal field of view; 6 were under the nose; 12 were in frame.
  - The "37 m served-range error" compared the subject's estimate with the
    *nearest* pedestrian — a bystander beside the aircraft. Against the
    pedestrian under the detection box (ticks 340–700) the estimate was 43.3 m
    and that person 49.4 m away; against the nearest visible pedestrian the gap
    is 1.8 m. The estimate was roughly right about the person being followed.
- **"Depth sampled through an 8-pixel box is the background"** was an inference
  from that comparison, never a measurement, and falls with it.

- **"P0 escape rate is 0.0 on every flight recorded here"** (README, Pages). It
  is 0.0 on all 41 shielded flights; the five unshielded control flights read
  0.63, as they are designed to.

### Still true
- The ring fired 94 times; on 63 of them no real pedestrian was within 10 m.
- The pedestrian-phase detector does not beat a centre constant (7.0 px against
  5.9 px).
- A real pedestrian came within 4.70 m of the aircraft while
  `p0_violation_escape_rate` read 0.0. The gap it exposes is **policy scope**
  (no rule protects non-subject pedestrians) and **sensor coverage** (a forward
  camera cannot see beside the aircraft) — not a wrong range estimate.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-10

### Added
- `CAMERA_HFOV_DEG`, read from the simulator config at import, and used as the
  default for `servo`, `implied_width_m`, `range_from_depth` and `TargetLock`.
- `det_gt_err_deg_median_in_shot` and its centre-constant null, plus
  `frame_widths_seen`, in `track_truth.score_rows`.
- Two regression tests: one changes the config and asserts the reader follows;
  one walks the AST for a literal `45.0`/`90.0` handed to `radians()`.

### Changed
- **FrontCamera raised from 400×225 to 768×432**, scene and depth together.
  `OwlViTProcessor` resizes every input to 768×768, so the forward pass does not
  depend on capture resolution — measured on an RTX 4090, median of 20, one
  query: 400×225 → 12.6 ms, 768×432 → 12.5 ms, 1280×720 → 13.2 ms. A 400×225
  frame was being upscaled 1.9× into the model. End to end 768×432 is *faster*
  than what it replaces (30.7 ms against 35.2 ms).

### Fixed
- `math.radians(45.0)` was inlined in the estimator feed — the camera's
  half-FOV, as a literal — while `servo()` three hundred lines away took
  `hfov_deg` as a parameter. Re-aiming the camera would have scaled every
  estimator bearing wrong, served the Shield a subject in the wrong direction,
  and raised nothing.

### Known limitations
- **The 768×432 change has not been flown.** Offline measurement says it costs
  nothing; behaviour under Unreal's GPU contention is unmeasured, and that
  contention is severe — across five recorded flights the forward pass runs
  13.8–21.5× slower in flight while preprocessing runs only 1.8–2.6× slower.
  The detector is GPU-starved, not CPU-bound.
- Raising resolution buys *detail*, not *size*: model pixels are
  `(angular width / hfov) × 768` regardless of capture resolution. A 0.5 m
  pedestrian still occupies 0.48 of one 32×32 patch at 16 m. Only a narrower
  FOV changes that, and it is not yet taken.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added
- `SUBJECT_VMAX_MPS` and a post-update velocity clamp in `TargetState`. A
  constant-velocity filter cannot know that a person does not travel at
  13 m/s; once the estimate ran away, its own 4σ gate rejected 149 of the next
  154 measurements and it coasted the runaway velocity to the end of the
  flight. Pedestrian phase on replay: estimate served 55/331 → 257/331, error
  to the nearest real pedestrian 31.08 m → 9.15 m.
- `yaw_command` — one yaw cap in one place. The coast branch clipped to
  1.1 rad/s and the estimator branch clipped to nothing; `TargetState.observe()`
  can return a bearing behind the aircraft, so it reached 130.4 deg/s.
- `track_truth.score_standoff_firings` — TP/FP/FN and precision/recall per
  `SubjectStandoff` ring, surfaced in `metrics.json` as `standoff_score`.

### Retracted
- **The claim that the 10 m pedestrian stand-off "fired six times" was the
  demonstration the rule finally worked.** Scored against ground truth from the
  same flight log: 0 true positives, 6 false, 49 false negatives, precision
  0.00. All six fired against a diverged estimate 3.81–9.39 m away while the
  nearest real pedestrian was 16.23–16.53 m away.
- Three candidate fixes were measured and dropped rather than shipped: a
  presence-gated selection filter (the verdict marks the *car* phase's most
  accurate boxes as absent), an implied-width gate on the estimator (its
  apparent win is the speed clamp's, and together they are worse than the clamp
  alone), and an implied-width gate on selection.

### Fixed
- The re-flight comparison quoted whole-flight figures for two flights of
  different length (69.95 s against 119.95 s). On the matched window every
  figure is better than published — median |yaw| 11.5 → 1.3 deg/s, peak
  130.4 → 9.6 — and so is the thing that matters less: the aircraft came 4.70 m
  from a real person against the previous flight's 9.43 m.

### Known limitations
- `p0_violation_escape_rate` reads 0.0 on a flight where a real pedestrian came
  within 10 m on 516 ticks and the stand-off rule fired on 31. *(Corrected in
  0.5.1: 498 of the 516 were people outside the camera's view whom the
  subject-only rule does not protect — a scope and coverage gap, not a range
  error.)*

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-08

### Added
- `guardrail/replay.py` — WP4 replay bundles that re-derive their own KPIs.
- `guardrail/frames.py` — the body/world Action4D boundary, with `yaw_rate`
  documented as rad/s and pinned by test.
- `demo/occ_bands.py` — altitude-band-aware obstacle map selection.

### Changed
- The headline tracking statistic moved from `frac_on_target` to the median
  pixel error against a null family (uniform draw, centre constant, best fixed
  column, lag-1 persistence).

### Retracted
- **`frac_on_target` at a 100 px tolerance is a statistic a constant can pass.**
  A "detector" that emits the frame centre and never opens the image scores
  1.000 on `city_locked` — margin exactly 0.000 — and *beats* the real detector
  on `city_full`.
- `replay.py`'s `VERIFIED_KPI_FIELDS` named two keys nothing emits, so it
  compared five fields and reported seven; one of them was a grant KPI. Its
  policy guard was also skipped whenever `manifest.json` was absent, so a real
  flight bundled cleanly under all 26 foreign policies.
- Test runners printed `PASS` for fixture-less tests: "8/8 passed" for a run in
  which seven asserted nothing.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-01 → 2026-09-07

### Added
- Scenario sweep harness (`experiments/sweep_scenarios.py`).
- Two previously unmeasured grant KPIs, and two previously unbuilt rules.
- Signed policy bundles, WGS84 policy origins, and a start-up refusal for a
  rule no `--object` phrase can reach.
- September deck built from the artefacts rather than from memory, and the
  meeting pack.

### Fixed
- **A `SubjectStandoff` rule that was hashed, audited, and completely inert.**
  The policy named class `pedestrian`; the phrase `a person` produced `person`;
  `binds()` compares exact strings. Across a whole flight with a human subject
  it bound zero times and the 5 m catch-all applied instead. No violation is
  indistinguishable from no rule.
- `--want-width` is an *angular* target, so the stand-off it asks for scales
  with the subject's width — 15.83 m for a 4 m car, 1.98 m for a 0.5 m person.
  The retarget block updated the width and not the set-point derived from it,
  so the aircraft station-kept at the car's distance and was commanded
  *backwards* at −1.18 m/s while doing so.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-24 → 2026-08-31

Initial Guardrail layer: the policy DSL (WP1), the prefix compiler (WP2), the
suffix Safety Shield (WP3) and stress testing (WP4); the first KPI-grade
results on the ArduPilot SITL rail; occupancy maps built from the simulator
rather than inferred from empty space; scripted city scenes with traffic,
parked vehicles and pedestrians; and the two-view recorder.

## Publication note

This history was rewritten once, at first publication on 2026-09-10, to remove
`meeting notes/` and `docs/CORRECTIONS-2026-09-02.md` — internal records naming
colleagues, withheld deliberately. Every commit SHA therefore differs from the
pre-publication working copy, and four commit hashes cited in
`docs/CHECKLIST-remaining-work.md`, `docs/FINDING-the-kpi-was-never-measured.md`
and `docs/MIDTERM-REPORT-Aug2026.md` refer to that earlier history. One commit
("Record the 2026-09-02 meeting…") touched only the removed paths and was
pruned as empty, so the published history is 50 commits where the working copy
has 51.
